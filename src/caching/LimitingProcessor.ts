/**
 * Limiting processor is a pauseable scheduler of async function calls. It is mainly
 * used for processing transactions in a block. For example, given a block,
 * one may need to asynchronous process all the transactions in a block, where processing each
 * transaction may require making additional async calls. For example for an UTXO transaction,
 * we may want to read all the input transactions. A limiting processor instance is used to process
 * a single block. This triggers processing of the block transactions in the sequence, which are considered
 * as the top level jobs. Each transaction processing triggers further processing of the input transactions
 * as sub-jobs. While top level jobs (block transactions) are processed in the sequence (using queue),
 * second level jobs (input transactions) are injected to the beginning of the queue thus implying that
 * start of processing of the next top level job has lower priority then the start of sub-jobs of
 * previous top level jobs.
 *
 * Such a processing can be paused at any time. Note that limiting processor is supposed to work with
 * cached client, which actually fetches and caches responses for the transaction data from API nodes.
 * In addition the cached client maintains a queue of scheduled calls, which are in processing or are to
 * be processed. Since the client is rate-limited, limiting processor pushes the jobs (API calls) to the client
 * in a controlled manner, taking care that there are not too many jobs in that queue, roughly just for
 * the next 1 second. In such a way, when the limiting processor is paused, the jobs that are still
 * in processing clear out in about 1 second. By pausing a limiting processor, we essentially
 * temporarily stop processing a blok on a certain transaction. Processing can be resumed later at
 * the point of stopping. Once all the transactions (top-level) jobs are completed, the processing of
 * the limiting processor class is done and results can be extracted and used elsewhere.
 *
 * Such a functionality is important in managing the priority of block processing on chains that
 * have several forks. The priority is always the main fork, but as it switches on a node,
 * we pause limiting block processor and resume/initialize a limiting processor on the block
 * of the same height on the other fork that became main now.
 * This happens for every switch. Since transaction calls are cached by
 * caching client and since the blocks on the same height are likely to contain a large number of
 * same transactions, caching helps in preventing unnecessary API calls.
