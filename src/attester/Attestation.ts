 * Attestation class is class holding the state of an attestation throughout whole life-cycle, which includes:

 * Attestation request events are obtained by {@link AttesterClient}, passed to {@link AttestationRoundManager} and further to
 * {@link AttestationRound} for a specific voting round, where a list of all attestation round in the sequence of appearance is kept and processed (passed to verifiers, responses checked, etc.)
