# Using the State Connector System

## What is the State Connector system?

The State Connector system is a request-response-based system that supports proving certain data and facts from other blockchains and data sources. It runs on Flare Networks (Songbird, Flare, Coston, and Coston2).

## Why would I need the State Connector system?

One example is that you can implement a smart contract on the Flare Network, which acts upon the proof that someone made a specific payment on the Bitcoin network. For example, someone can buy an NFT on Flare Network and pay on Bitcoin. Once the payment is made, the proof is requested from the State Connector system and used by the NFT smart contract to mint the NFT.

Another example would be that you require a specific payment in XRP up to a certain timestamp to release collateral on Flare. The State Connector system can be used to prove that the payment was made by the due date (and the collateral can be released), or it can be used to prove that the payment was not carried out by the due date and the proof can be used to liquidate the collateral.

The State Connector system allows for extensions of the types of proofs and blockchain data sources in the form of new attestation types. Once those are introduced, they can be used for new use cases.

## How can the State Connector system be used?

To prove a given fact, say about a transaction with a given `txid` on the Bitcoin network, we create an attestation request (a specific JSON object).

The request is then encoded into the byte sequence and submitted to the [StateConnector](../attestation-protocol/state-connector-contract.md) contract.

After 3-5 mins, the request is either confirmed or not. If it is confirmed, the attestations are grouped into a Merkle tree and the Merkle root is stored in the [StateConnector](../attestation-protocol/state-connector-contract.md) contract.

Checking whether the attestation request was proven and obtaining the proof data is carried out through REST API routes served by attestation providers.

Once the proof data is obtained, it can be submitted to a smart contract that can verify the proof and act upon it.

## What is an attestation request?

An attestation request is a type of predefined and parametrized query submitted to the [StateConnector](../attestation-protocol/state-connector-contract.md) smart contract with the goal of proving certain data or facts from an external data source. An example of an attestation request is _"confirm that a certain payment is confirmed on the Bitcoin chain"_. Such an attestation request triggers validation of the query by attestation providers in a decentralized manner. If the query gives a positive response, certain data called attestation responses are produced and attested to by each attestation provider. See details for attestation protocol [here](../attestation-protocol/attestation-protocol.md).

## What is an attestation response?

An attestation response is a response obtained in the process of verification of an attestation request when the attestation request finds a match. The request and response are in JSON format. The Typescript types for attestation responses matching attestation requests are available from the [attestation hash types](../../src/verification/generated/attestation-hash-types.ts) file.

## Which kinds of attestation requests can the State Connector system currently perform?

The list of the supported types of attestation requests is available on the [State Connector attestation type repo](https://github.com/flare-foundation/state-connector-attestation-types). It includes the formats of attestation requests for specific types, attestation responses, and the rules for verification.

## How can I form an attestation request?

An attestation request is formed in JSON format and then encoded to the relevant byte sequence. Understanding of attestation type [definitions](https://github.com/flare-foundation/state-connector-attestation-types) and the context of the data we want to prove is essential in filling in the request data. The JSON structure of the attestation requests is available from the [attestation request types](../../src/verification/generated/attestation-request-types.ts) file. The functions for encoding JSON formats to byte sequences represented with `0x`-prefixed hex strings are available from the [attestation request encode](../../src/verification/generated/attestation-request-encode.ts) file. See also the question about the [use of the code as a Typescript library](#which-code-should-i-use-in-my-web-ui-application-to-handle-attestation-requests-and-attestation-responses) below.
Certain [REST API routes](./apis.md) provided by attestation providers can be used when forming attestation requests.

## Which generic fields does each attestation request have?

Each [attestation request](../../src/verification/generated/attestation-request-types.ts) in JSON form has three generic fields:

- `attestationType` - enum, of the type [AttestationType](../../src/verification/generated/attestation-types-enum.ts)
- `sourceId` - enum, of the type [SourceId](../../src/verification/sources/sources.ts)
- `messageIntegrityCode` - a `0x`-prefixed 32-byte string, a hash that is used to indicate what attestation response should be obtained.

## What is message integrity code?

Attestation requests are used to obtain proofs from the State Connector system. The attestation process provides an attestation request and, if they verify it, they obtain an attestation response. When sending the request, we already know what the correct response should be, and we just want the State Connector system to provide a proof for the data, which can be used with smart contracts on a Flare Networks blockchain.

To provide better security and stability for the State Connector system, the protocol requires that we indicate, in an unambiguous way, what the response should be using the message integrity code. This is obtained by essentially taking the expected attestation response and concatenating the string `Flare` to it as a _salt_ (data added for security). The helper functions for doing this are available in the [attestation hash utils](../../src/verification/generated/attestation-hash-utils.ts) file.

## How can I calculate a message integrity code?

First you need to form the attestation request with all the fields except the `messageIntegrityCode`, which can be set to an empty string. The
object should match the fields of the relevant [attestation request type](../../src/verification/generated/attestation-request-types.ts). Then there are two options:

- Form the object for the [expected attestation response](../../src/verification/generated/attestation-hash-types.ts), using the relevant hashing function from the [hashing library](../../src/verification/generated/attestation-hash-utils.ts) and the `Flare` salt.
- Use one of the verifier server REST API methods provided by any attestation provider (`/verifier/<chain>/integrity` or `/verifier/<chain>/prepareAttestation`). Verifier server REST APIs usually require an API key.

## How to submit an attestation request?

Attestation requests should be submitted to the [StateConnector](../attestation-protocol/state-connector-contract.md) smart contract on a relevant Flare Networks blockchain (Flare, Songbird, Coston, Coston2) using the function:

```solidity
function requestAttestations(bytes calldata _data) external;
```

The `_data` parameter is the `0x`-prefixed byte sequence encoded attestation request. To communicate with the blockchain, libraries such as `web3` or `ethers` can be used.

## What happens after I submit an attestation request?

If the transaction calling the `requestAttestations(...)` function on the [StateConnector](../attestation-protocol/state-connector-contract.md) smart contract is successful, the attestation request is successfully submitted. It is important to read out the transaction's timestamp from the blockchain, since the timestamp determines the voting round ID to which the transaction is submitted (see the question below).

A successfully submitted transaction triggers validation of the attestation request by attestation providers. The result of validation is available
in 3 to 5 minutes.

### How do I know in which voting round ID my attestation request was submitted?

Based on the block timestamp of the attestation request transaction, the attestation request gets assigned to a voting round (`roundId`).
By reading the variables `BUFFER_TIMESTAMP_OFFSET` and `BUFFER_WINDOW` from the [State Connector](../attestation-protocol/state-connector-contract.md) smart contract, we can calculate `roundId` from the transaction's `block.timestamp` as follows:

```solidity
roundId = (block.timestamp - BUFFER_TIMESTAMP_OFFSET) / BUFFER_WINDOW
```

Note that `block.timestamp` is in seconds on Flare Networks, thus it is an integer number. The division in the formula above is integer division (i.e., floor division, dropping the decimals places and taking the lower number).

## Who are attestation providers?

They are external entities that verify attestation requests by looking into data on relevant external data sources or blockchains. Verification is done by each attestation provider independently in a decentralized manner. Each attestation provider also provides certain REST API routes that can be used to obtain attestation proofs, monitor attestation request progress, and help in forming correct attestation requests.

## Do I submit an attestation request to an attestation provider?

No. Submit attestation requests to a Flare Networks blockchain, using the `requestAttestations(...)` function on the [StateConnector](../attestation-protocol/state-connector-contract.md) smart contract.

## Which code should I use in my web UI application to handle attestation requests and attestation responses?

For encoding, decoding, and hashing operations, use the Typescript code that can be extracted from the following folders:

- `src/verification/attestation-types`
- `src/verification/generated`
- `src/verification/sources`

The external NPM dependencies include:

- `web3`
- `glob`
- `bn.js`

## How do I get a proof for the submitted attestation request?

If the attestation request was successfully validated, two pieces of data help you find the proof data.

When you submit an attestation request, take note of these two pieces of data:

    - The byte encoded attestation request.
    - The `roundId` in which the attestation request was submitted.

In order to obtain the proof, certain REST API routes on attestation provider servers need to be queried. For that purpose, relevant URL(s) of attestation providers' public servers need to be obtained and queried. To obtain the proof for a specific request, use the API route `/api/proof/get-specific-proof` on an attestation provider's server. Include the two pieces of data stated above, as the input parameters of the POST request. See [REST APIs provided by attestation providers](./apis.md) for more details.

The response of the API route contains all the needed data to assemble the proof ready to be submitted to a verifying contract.

## What if I cannot obtain the proof from the REST API of an attestation provider's server?

If your attestation request was successfully submitted, there are several possibilities when no proof is available on `/api/proof/get-specific-proof`:

- Not enough time has passed. Retry later. If the result exists, it should be available in at most 5 minutes, usually less.
- The specific attestation provider did not participate in the voting round. Try the API route on some other attestation provider's server.
- The attestation request was not validated. Use `/api/proof/requests-for-round/{roundId}` to see the status of all attestation requests in the specific round.

## How do I assemble attestation proof for use with the verifying smart contract?

The attestation proof consists of the following data:

- `roundId` of the attestation request.
- Attestation response, which consists of the data about the result of the attestation request, in the form as described in the definition of each attestation type.
- Merkle proof.

The data for assembling the proof should be obtained from an attestation provider's [REST API as described above](#how-can-i-form-an-attestation-request).

Use the data obtained from the REST API to fill in the relevant struct object defined in [ISCProofVerifier.sol](../../contracts/generated/interface/ISCProofVerifier.sol). Some Javascript and Typescript libraries like `web3.js` and `ethers.js` allow sending structs as JSON objects. Hence, you can use the attestation response JSON object and add the key `merkleProof`, a list of 32-byte hex hashes. Then the relevant `chainId` (see [sources.ts](../../src/verification/sources/sources.ts)) and the assembled JSON object can be used in verification functions on the contract. For example, to verify the proof, given an `assembled_proof_json`, for the `Payment` attestation type on the Ripple blockchain (the Ripple `chainId` is 3), the call `verifyPayment(3, assembled_proof_json)` returns `true` if done on a deployed contract.

## To which smart contract can or should I submit the attestation proof?

This depends on the dApp that utilizes the State Connector proofs to allow certain actions based on a successful proof. A generic implementation of verification functions is available here in [SCProofVerifierBase.sol](../../contracts/generated/contracts/SCProofVerifierBase.sol).

An example of such a contract deployed on Coston2 network is on the [Read Contract tab of SCProofVerifier](https://coston2-explorer.flare.network/address/0xA8083d78B6ABC328b4d3B714F76F384eCC7147e1/read-contract#address-tabs). Use the verification functions (named `verify<attestation type name>(...)`) to check the proofs.

## How can I implement a dApp that uses proofs for a State Connector system?

To support all the currently available proofs and have verifier functions readily available, develop a custom contract by inheriting [SCProofVerifier.sol](../../contracts/generated/contracts/SCProofVerifier.sol) and implement relevant methods that use the verification methods from the inherited [SCProofVerifierBase.sol](../../contracts/generated/contracts/SCProofVerifierBase.sol).

For easier understanding, see an [example attestation verification workflow](./verification-workflow.md).

## How can I add a new attestation type?

Definitions for state connector are defined in the [State Connector attestation type repo](https://github.com/flare-foundation/state-connector-attestation-types).

The first step for adding the new attestation types includes providing the consistent definition on that repository and obtaining the acceptance by the community. The next step is the actual implementation of support for the type. This usually includes implementation of the supporting code for the attestation client and relevant verifier services and indexers.
